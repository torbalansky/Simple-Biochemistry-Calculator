'Simple Biochemistry Calculator' is a web-based application designed for molarity calculations and dilution preparations. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The molarity calculator determines the amount of compound needed to attain a particular molar concentration and volume by computing the mass required, using the following equation m(g) = C(mol/L) x V(L) x Mw(g/mol). The dilution calculator tool helps determine the necessary volume of a stock concentrate to add in order to obtain a desired volume and concentration, using the following formula - C1V1 = C2V2.

In the future, I plan to make the user interface more visually appealing and improve the overall functionality.
